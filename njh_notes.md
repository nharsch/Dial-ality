  - 2021.2.4f1
  - opened unity
    - open unity hub
    - create new project
    - open new project
~~- [X] install ECS?~~
- [X] how to create cloud object
  - create empty object with collider
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ7Umjp6R10
    - trigger collider will send trigger message
- [X] create game components
- [X] add state variables to components
- [X] implement reactive UI state on objects
  - [X] add update handlers to objects
    - [X] mountain
      - [X] only freeze in cold
    - [X] cloud
      - [X] should not rotate with world
    - [X] lake
    - [X] farm
- [X] implement hit boxes
  - [X] implement collision handlers job
    - [X] change component state vars
    - [X] put collision handler on sun collision box zones
      - check if box has hit a game object
        - change it's sun level
    - [X] cloud collision handler
      - [X] if colliding with lake and sun level is 2, update intensity to 1
      - [X] if colliding with lake and lake sun level is 3, update intensity to 2, change lake water var false
      - [X] if colliding with mountain and active, update raining var, update mountain water var
      - [X] if colliding with object and raining, update object water var
      - if colliding with lake and lake water is false, update rain var and active var
- [X] create timer
  - function timer video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hsppNzx7_0
- [ ] fix sun left side collider issue
